# Data Science Portfolio by Shannon Chowdhury 

This page will display all the data science projects I have created. I will try to provide a brief overview of each project. 

## Kaggle Projects
### KANNADA MNIST CNN 
Implemented CNN using tf.keras to achieve an accuracy of 98.4%. Used data visualization, experimentation with max pooling and data augmentation to improve the score. 

### MNIST Digit Recognition
This project was my first project working with CNNs and Tensorflow. This project will guide the viewer through how I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and created a model with data augmentation. Utlimately reaching the Top 23%.

### House Prices Kernel
Performed data visualization, cleaning, wrangling, feature extraction and selection to create a regression model to predict the house value. 

### Iris Database Experiment
Experimenting with the Iris Database and performing simple EDA and modeling.

### Pima Indian Diabetes EDA and Model
Exploring the database with visualizations and then developing a predictive model to determine who is likely to develop diabetes.

### Healthcare Dataset Stroke Data EDA and Modeling
Exploring the database with visualizations and then developing a predictive model to determine who is likely to stroke.

### Cardio EDA and Ensemble Methods
Exploring the database with visualizations and then developing a predictive model to determine who is likely to stroke. Used Sk-Learn to create 

### Chest X-ray Classification with Fast.AI
Using a CNN to detect which X-rays have pneumonia and which X-do not. Used Fast.AI library to create the CNN with variable learning rate and trasnfer learning from using a ResNet.
