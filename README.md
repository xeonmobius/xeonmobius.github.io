# Data Science Portfolio by Shannon Chowdhury 

This page will display all the data science projects I have created. I will provide a brief overview of each project. 

## Deployed Personal Projects
### Coronavirus Tracker for Canada[1](https://covidtrackr.herokuapp.com)
Used the data collected by Berry I, et al. to create a website that displays the total infection, total death and total recovery rates. The data is presented with Chart.JS, unwrangled with pandas, and the backend is built on Flask. All deployed on Heroku. 
Stack: python, pandas, flask, chart.js, pandas

## Kaggle Projects
### KANNADA MNIST CNN[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/hiragana-mnist)
Implemented a CNN using tf.keras to achieve an accuracy of 98.4%. Used Data visualization, max pooling, data augmentation to improve the score. 
Stack: python, tensorflow, matplotlib, pandas

### MNIST Digit Recognition[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/my-attempt-at-mnist)
This project was my first project working with CNNs and Tensorflow. This project will guide the viewer through how I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and created a model with data augmentation. Reached the top 23%.
Stack: python, tensorflow, matplotlib

### House Prices Kernel[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/house-prices-kernel)
Performed data visualization, cleaning, wrangling, feature extraction and selection to create a regression model to predict the house value. 
Stack: matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost

### Iris Database Experiment[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/iris-database-experiment)
Experimenting with the Iris Database and performing simple EDA and modeling.
Stack: matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

### Pima Indian Diabetes EDA and Model[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/pima-indian-diabetes-eda-and-model)
Exploring the database with visualizations and then developing a predictive model to determine who is likely to develop diabetes.
Stack: matplotlib, xgboost, seaborn, sklearn

### Healthcare Dataset Stroke Data EDA and Modeling[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data-eda-and-modeling)
Exploring the database with visualizations and then developing a predictive model to determine who is likely to stroke.
Stack: matplotlib, seaborn

### Cardio EDA and Ensemble Methods[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/cardio-eda-and-ensemble-methods)
Exploring the database with visualizations and then developing a predictive model to determine who is likely to stroke.
Stack: sklearn, matplotlib,

### Chest X-ray Classification with Fast.AI[1](https://www.kaggle.com/gundamb2/chest-x-ray-classification-with-fast-ai)
Using a CNN to detect which X-rays have pneumonia and which X-do not. Used Fast.AI library to create the CNN with variable learning rate and trasnfer learning from using a ResNet.
Stack: fast-ai
