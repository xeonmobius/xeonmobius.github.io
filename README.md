# Data Science Portfolio by Shannon Chowdhury 

This page will display all the data science projects I have created. I will try to provide a brief overview of each project. Projects are separated as Kaggle and Non Kaggle projects

## Kaggle Projects
### MNIST Digit Recognition
This project was my first project working with CNNs and Tensorflow. This project will guide the viewer through how I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and created a model with data augmentation. Utlimately reaching the Top 23%.
